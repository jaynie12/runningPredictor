Testing plan:

1. Submit the route without anything on the map -  validate an error returns back
2. Draw a route, enter the age group and gender. Press submit and validate that the elevation ,weather, and route 
gets populated on the web page
3. Validate that you can interact with the thumbs up and thumbs down buttons that appear once the 
route information has been populated
4. Validate that you can zoom out and in with the map and can break up your route into segments
5. Repeat for a range of age groups and genders so that we can prove that the time taken to create the route
varies accross the different categories
